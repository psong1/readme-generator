  ## [Description](#table-of-contents)

  This application uses node.js to dynamically create a README file. It includes a series of prompts that wants users to include information about the application, such as the title, a description, installation/user guide, contributions to the application, etc.

  ## [Installation](#table-of-contents)

  Users can install the application by using the HTTPS and 'git clone' through the terminal, or by downloading the zip file.

  ## [Usage](#table-of-contents)

  Once the application, node.js, and inquirer npm have been installed, users can log 'node index' in the terminal. This will provide the prompts one-by-one to the user.

  ##[Contributions](#table-of-contents)

  At this time, this is a solo project.

  ## [Test](#table-of-contents)

  When there are responses to all prompts, a README.md file will be generated with all of the responses in Markdown. Users can view this in the README.md file that will be generated in the repository.
